I am currently working on an internship task at IT Club. This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate basic data manipulation and matrix operations using NumPy and pandas.  

### Tasks Included:  
1. **Matrix Operations with NumPy** â€“ Performing addition, subtraction, and multiplication on matrices.  
2. **Data Table Manipulation with pandas** â€“ Creating a dataset of student scores, filtering rows, adding new columns, and calculating basic statistics like mean and median.  

This project showcases fundamental data handling skills using Python. ðŸš€
